# Graph2Grid 

Graph2Grid is a tool to convert Graph Maps to 2D Grids using recursion and 

                    Current features:

- Conversion from a Graph to a Grid by using a recursive function.
- Generating a Random Graph that may or may not comply with the 2D representation (as for now)
- Displaying the generated Grid Object.

                    Future features:

- Making the Graph Generator return a correct grid that follows up the constrains of a 2D representation
- Dijkstra's algorithm for calculating the shortest path for a route defined by the user
- Simple Chunk loading
